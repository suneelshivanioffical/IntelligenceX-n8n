# Introduction

The recruitment process is often one of the most time-consuming and complex stages of business operations. From sorting through hundreds of CVs to identifying qualified candidates and matching them with open roles, HR teams spend hours manually screening applicants often missing great talent due to human limitations or data overload.

The AI Recruiting System was designed to solve this challenge by automating the entire hiring pipeline using AI-driven analysis and workflow automation. It intelligently extracts candidate data, scores skill sets, matches applicants to suitable roles, and notifies HR of top candidates, all without any manual intervention.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Problem Statement

Recruiters today face several recurring issues:

- Thousands of applications make manual screening inefficient and slow.
- Important candidate details (skills, experience, education, etc.) are easily overlooked.
- Human bias and inconsistency affect selection quality.
- Communication delays between departments lead to lost opportunities.

As a result, businesses often spend too much time and resources managing early-stage hiring while struggling to identify the right talent efficiently.

# Workflow Logic (Breakdown)

Candidate submits CV → Webhook trigger → Upload to Google Drive → Extract info → Match job roles → Add to Google Sheet → Score & filter → Email summary to HR

# Proposed Solution

The AI Recruiting System automates end-to-end candidate processing using n8n workflows and AI analysis.

Here’s how it works:

1. A candidate submits their CV through a web form or portal.
2. The system captures the submission via a webhook and securely uploads the CV to Google Drive.
3. The workflow extracts key details such as name, email, education, experience, and skills using an AI data extraction model.
4. It matches the extracted profile with current job requirements to identify suitable roles.
5. Candidate data is stored in Google Sheets for centralized tracking.
6. The AI then assigns scores for technical skills, soft skills, and overall job fit.
7. Based on predefined criteria, only shortlisted candidates are filtered and automatically emailed to the HR department via Gmail with summaries and recommendations.

This automation ensures HR only reviews high-potential candidates, drastically reducing manual work and improving hiring accuracy.

# Technical Details

The AI Recruiting System is built in n8n, integrating tools like Google Drive, Google Sheets, Gmail, and Google Gemini to automate the entire hiring process. When a candidate submits a CV, it’s stored in Google Drive, and Google Gemini extracts key information such as skills, education, and experience and more. The processed data is recorded in Google Sheets for tracking, while scoring and filtering logic shortlists top candidates. Finally, Gmail sends detailed summaries to HR with candidate scores and recommendations, creating a seamless, end-to-end automated recruitment pipeline.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Output

By the end of the workflow:

The entire process from CV upload to HR notification occurs in real time and requires zero manual input.

# Future Improvements

Some possible enhancements to this system include:

- Integration with LinkedIn or Job Boards: Automatically fetch candidate profiles and resumes.
- Analytics Dashboard: Visualize candidate statistics, rejection rates, and hiring efficiency.
- CRM/ATS Integration: Sync shortlisted candidates with existing HR management tools.
- Auto-Reply Emails: Notify candidates of their application status automatically..

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Conclusion:

The AI Recruiting System revolutionizes how businesses approach talent acquisition. By integrating Google Drive, Google Sheets, Gmail, and Google Gemini within n8n, it replaces manual screening with intelligent automation.

This system empowers HR teams to focus on strategic decision-making rather than administrative tasks. The result is a faster, fairer, and more data-driven hiring process that ensures the best candidates are identified and recommended all with minimal effort.
