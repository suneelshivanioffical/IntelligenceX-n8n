# Introduction

Businesses often receive massive volumes of customer feedback across multiple platforms like websites, forms, and support systems. Manually sorting through each message to identify complains, compliments, or feature requests is slow, inefficient, and often leads to delayed responses or overlooked issues.

To solve this, the Customer Sentiments Analysis - Feedbacks system automates the classification and routing of feedback using an AI-powered workflow. This ensures that every message reaches the right team in real time, improving response speed, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Problem Statement

Most companies struggle to efficiently process and respond to customer feedback. Common issues include:

- Manual sorting of responses leading to delays.
- Miscommunication between departments handling feedback.
- Missed opportunities for improvement due to unstructured data.
- High workload on support teams dealing with repetitive tasks.

The need was clear, a system that could analyze sentiment, categorize feedback, and notify the right teams automatically.

# Workflow Logic (Breakdown)

Form Submission → AI Agent → Merge → Switch → Route to Team → Notify/Respond

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Proposed Solution

This workflow uses n8n, a powerful automation platform combined with AI sentiment analysis and communication integrations to classify and route customer feedback automatically.

Here’s the concept:

1. Customer submits feedback through a connected form.
2. The Google Gemini AI Model analyzes the feedback message.
3. The system identifies whether the message is a complaint, compliment, or feature request.
4. Depending on the result:
    - Complains are forwarded to the complaints department and a response email is sent to the customer.
    - Compliments are shared with the owner or main team via Slack/Email.
    - Feature requests are sent to the development team for review.
6. All feedback and results are logged automatically in Google Sheets for record keeping and analytics.

# Technical Details

The workflow is built in n8n, integrating multiple tools for seamless automation. Google Gemini is used for sentiment and intent analysis, interpreting feedback messages and classifying them as complaints, compliments, or feature requests. Google Sheets stores all categorized feedback for tracking and reporting. Gmail automatically sends acknowledgment or follow-up emails to customers, while Slack delivers instant notifications to the relevant internal teams. Together, these tools create a smart, connected system that handles feedback efficiently and in real time.

# Output

At the end of the automation process:

1. Complains are logged in Google Sheets, forwarded to the complaint department, and acknowledged user via email.
   
- user_complain
